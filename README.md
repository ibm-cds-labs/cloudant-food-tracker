# Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift) - With Cloud Data Sync

This walkthrough is a "sequel" to Apple's well-known iOS programming introduction, [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)][apple-doc]. Apple's introduction walks us through the process of building the UI, data, and logic of an example food tracker app, culiminating with a section on data persistence: storing the app data as files in the iOS device.

This document picks up where that document leaves off: syncing data between devices, through the cloud, with an offline-first design. You will achieve this using open source tools and the IBM Cloudant service.

## About the Lessons

These lessons assume that you have completed the [FoodTracker app][apple-doc] from Apple's walkthrough. Begin with the completed sample project from the final lesson: [Persist Data][apple-doc-download].

## CocoaPods

The first step is to connect with the broader open source iOS software community by installing free software packages using [CocoaPods][cocoapods]. You will use the CocoaPods repository to integrate the [Cloudant Sync Datastore][cdtdatastore-pod] library.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of the lesson, youâ€™ll be able to:

  1. Install CocoaPods on your Mac
  1. Use CocoaPods to download and integrate CDTDatastore with FoodTracker
  1. Build a bridging header to compile CDTDatastore into FoodTracker

### Install CocoaPods on your Mac

The CocoaPods web site has an excellent page, [Getting Started][cocoapods-getting-started], which covers intalling and upgrading. For your purposes, we will use the most simple, using the command-line `gem` program.

**To install CocoaPods**

  1. Open the Terminal application
    1. Click the Spotlight icon (a magnifying glass) in the Mac OS taskbar
    1. Type "terminal" in the Spotlight prompt, and press return
  1. In Terminal, type this command:

  ```
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

  1. Confirm that CocoaPods is installed with this command:

  ```
  pod --version
  ```

  You should see the CocoaPods version displayed in Terminal:

  ```
  0.39.0
  ```
