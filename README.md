# Cloudant FoodTracker

If you have explored iOS development, you probably followed Apple's [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)][start] lessons that walk you through building a simple app called FoodTracker.

Soon this repo will feature a tutorial that shows you how to transform Appleâ€™s FoodTracker into a true offline-first app that stores its data locally using Cloudant Sync for iOS and then synchronizes this data with IBM Cloudant. 

Stay tuned...
